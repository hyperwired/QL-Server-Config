# Parts of this plugin were inspired by iou(onegirl)'s autospec plugin.
# Deciding who to put to spectators it goes a whole different way though:

# We keep a dictionary containing all players on the server as keys and their
# PLAYTIME as values. In this context, playtime means for how long the player
# was in red or blue team in an ACTIVE GAME - no matter for how long
# he was alive though!

# For now, the plugin warns that teams are uneven on event round_countdown and 
# slays the player who was in-game the shortest on event round_start.

# I wrote a little timer module that can be used to start and stop timers.
# If a timer was stopped yet not cleared 
# (therefore you'd have to reinstantiate the object) 
# the modules' .start() method just resumes the timer.

# .elapsed() tells how many seconds have passed since the timer was
# _started_for_the_first_time_, no matter if it is paused or running.

# Please consider this a very early version and highly experimental. 
# I haven't tested it that much yet because testing these things is hard...
