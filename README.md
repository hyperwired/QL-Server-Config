# Quake Live â€“ Server Configuration
### Live configuration of the TomTec Solutions servers.

This is the live configuration of TomTec Solutions' servers in Australia. If you see something that can be improved upon, please edit the necessary files, and I'll be sure to consider it.

Feel free to create your own factories, 99% of the time they'll be added.

Some of these files are part of this Quake Live server implementation by TomTec Solutions. Do not copy or redistribute or link to the files with this warning on the topmost/second-topmost line without the emailed consent of Thomas Jones (thomas@tomtecsolutions.com).
