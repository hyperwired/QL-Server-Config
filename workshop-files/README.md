# Workshop Listing Files
Add all workshop IDs to `workshop_download.list` first, and then to the corresponding workshop file.

At the moment, servers read from `workshop_default.txt`, when the other gametype-specific files are modified and begin to have their own entries, they will be used too.

Anything that doesn't fit into a gametype category, add to the default file.
